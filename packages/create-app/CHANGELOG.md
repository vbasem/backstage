# @backstage/create-app

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 7d7abd50c: Add `app-backend` as a backend plugin, and make a single docker build of the backend the default way to deploy backstage.

  Note that the `app-backend` currently only is a solution for deployments of the app, it's not a dev server and is not intended for local development.

  ## Template changes

  As a part of installing the `app-backend` plugin, the below changes where made. The changes are grouped into two steps, installing the plugin, and updating the Docker build and configuration.

  ### Installing the `app-backend` plugin in the backend

  First, install the `@backstage/plugin-app-backend` plugin package in your backend. These changes where made for `v0.3.0` of the plugin, and the installation process might change in the future. Run the following from the root of the repo:

  ```bash
  cd packages/backend
  yarn add @backstage/plugin-app-backend
  ```

  For the `app-backend` to get access to the static content in the frontend we also need to add the local `app` package as a dependency. Add the following to your `"dependencies"` in `packages/backend/package.json`, assuming your app package is still named `app` and on version `0.0.0`:

  ```json
  "app": "0.0.0",
  ```

  Don't worry, this will not cause your entire frontend dependency tree to be added to the app, just double check that `packages/app/package.json` has a `"bundled": true` field at top-level. This signals to the backend build process that the package is bundled and that no transitive dependencies should be included.

  Next, create `packages/backend/src/plugins/app.ts` with the following:

  ```ts
  import { createRouter } from '@backstage/plugin-app-backend';
  import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';

  export default async function createPlugin({
    logger,
    config,
  }: PluginEnvironment) {
    return await createRouter({
      logger,
      config,
      appPackageName: 'app',
    });
  }
  ```

  In `packages/backend/src/index.ts`, make the following changes:

  Add an import for the newly created plugin setup file:

  ```ts
  import app from './plugins/app';
  ```

  Setup the following plugin env.

  ```ts
  const appEnv = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('app'));
  ```

  Change service builder setup to include the `app` plugin as follows. Note that the `app` plugin is not installed on the `/api` route with most other plugins.

  ```ts
  const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .loadConfig(config)
    .addRouter('/api', apiRouter)
    .addRouter('', await app(appEnv));
  ```

  You should now have the `app-backend` plugin installed in your backend, ready to serve the frontend bundle!

  ### Docker build setup

  Since the backend image is now the only one needed for a simple Backstage deployment, the image tag name in the `build-image` script inside `packages/backend/package.json` was changed to the following:

  ```json
  "build-image": "backstage-cli backend:build-image --build --tag backstage",
  ```

  For convenience, a `build-image` script was also added to the root `package.json` with the following:

  ```json
  "build-image": "yarn workspace backend build-image",
  ```

  In the root of the repo, a new `app-config.production.yaml` file was added. This is used to set the appropriate `app.baseUrl` now that the frontend is served directly by the backend in the production deployment. It has the following contents:

  ```yaml
  app:
    # Should be the same as backend.baseUrl when using the `app-backend` plugin
    baseUrl: http://localhost:7000

  backend:
    baseUrl: http://localhost:7000
    listen:
      port: 7000
  ```

  In order to load in the new configuration at runtime, the command in the `Dockerfile` at the repo root was changed to the following:

  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["node", "packages/backend", "--config", "app-config.yaml", "--config", "app-config.production.yaml"]
  ```

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c56e28375: Fix missing api-docs plugin registration in app template

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d29605db: Change the default backend plugin mount point to /api
- 5249594c5: Add service discovery interface and implement for single host deployments

  Fixes #1847, #2596

  Went with an interface similar to the frontend DiscoveryApi, since it's dead simple but still provides a lot of flexibility in the implementation.

  Also ended up with two different methods, one for internal endpoint discovery and one for external. The two use-cases are explained a bit more in the docs, but basically it's service-to-service vs callback URLs.

  This did get me thinking about uniqueness and that we're heading towards a global namespace for backend plugin IDs. That's probably fine, but if we're happy with that we should leverage it a bit more to simplify the backend setup. For example we'd have each plugin provide its own ID and not manually mount on paths in the backend.

  Draft until we're happy with the implementation, then I can add more docs and changelog entry. Also didn't go on a thorough hunt for places where discovery can be used, but I don't think there are many since it's been pretty awkward to do service-to-service communication.

- d7873e1aa: Default to using internal scope for new plugins
- 6f447b3fc: Remove identity-backend

  Not used, and we're heading down the route of identities in the catalog

- 61db1ddc6: Allow node v14 and add to master build matrix

  - Upgrade sqlite3@^5.0.0 in @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend
  - Add Node 14 to engines in @backstage/create-app

- a768a07fb: Add the ability to import users from GitHub Organization into the catalog.

  The token needs to have the scopes `user:email`, `read:user`, and `read:org`.

- f00ca3cb8: Auto-create plugin databases

  Relates to #1598.

  This creates databases for plugins before handing off control to plugins.

  The list of plugins currently need to be hard-coded depending on the installed plugins. A later PR will properly refactor the code to provide a factory pattern where plugins specify what they need, and Knex instances will be provided based on the input.

- 6d97d2d6f: The InfoCard variant `'height100'` is deprecated. Use variant `'gridItem'` instead.

  When the InfoCard is displayed as a grid item within a grid, you may want items to have the same height for all items.
  Set to the `'gridItem'` variant to display the InfoCard with full height suitable for Grid:
  `<InfoCard variant="gridItem">...</InfoCard>`

  Changed the InfoCards in '@backstage/plugin-github-actions', '@backstage/plugin-jenkins', '@backstage/plugin-lighthouse'
  to pass an optional variant to the corresponding card of the plugin.

  As a result the overview content of the EntityPage shows cards with full height suitable for Grid.

- 7aff112af: The default mount point for backend plugins have been changed to /api. These changes are done in the backend package itself, so it is recommended that you sync up existing backend packages with this new pattern.

### Patch Changes

- e67d49bf5: Sync scaffolded backend with example
- 961414d55: Remove discovery api override
- 440a17b39: Bump @backstage/catalog-backend and pass the now required UrlReader interface to the plugin
- 8c2b76e45: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The existing loading of additional config files like `app-config.development.yaml` using APP_ENV or NODE_ENV has been removed.
  Instead, the CLI and backend process now accept one or more `--config` flags to load config files.

  Without passing any flags, `app-config.yaml` and, if it exists, `app-config.local.yaml` will be loaded.
  If passing any `--config <path>` flags, only those files will be loaded, **NOT** the default `app-config.yaml` one.

  The old behaviour of for example `APP_ENV=development` can be replicated using the following flags:

  ```bash
  --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.development.yaml
  ```

- 5a920c6e4: Updated naming of environment variables. New pattern [NAME]\_TOKEN for Github, Gitlab, Azure & Github enterprise access tokens.

  ### Detail:

  - Previously we have to export same token for both, catalog & scaffolder

  ```bash
  export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=foo
  export GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN=foo
  ```

  with latest changes, only single export is sufficient.

  ```bash
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=foo
  export GITLAB_TOKEN=foo
  export GHE_TOKEN=foo
  export AZURE_TOKEN=foo
  ```

    <tr>
      <th>Old name</th>
      <th>New name</th>
